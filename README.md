# QR-code-Attendance Project

This project has been refactored into two standalone applications:

- **`admin-app/`**: Contains the administrative interface for managing QR code attendance.
- **`student-app/`**: Contains the student-facing application for scanning QR codes.

Each application is a separate Expo project and can be run independently.

## Getting Started

To run either application:

1.  Navigate into the desired application directory (e.g., `cd admin-app` or `cd student-app`).
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start the Expo development server: `npx expo start`

Follow the instructions in the Expo CLI to open the app on your device or in a web browser.
